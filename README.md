# Java-Code
Conglomerate of Java code from college mostly from the book but also assignments code metrics claims its 37k Lines; it didn't feel like that much.

Feel Free to copy any of this code here (unless you're another student from Georgia Southern using it for class)
If you are a student you can use the code but do not copy unless you give credit so the professor knows you did as some assignments/projects do allow copied code for a few scripts etc.
Please do not use any code here for malicious intent (I Don't know how you'd do that but don't)
